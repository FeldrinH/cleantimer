# [cleantimer](https://cleantimer.vercel.app)

A simple countdown timer app.

Time can be entered in most natural language formats and will be parsed using [chrono](https://github.com/wanasit/chrono) (for example `21:00`, `tomorrow noon` and `23 minutes after 12:00` are all known to work).

Some customization options are available for the timer when hovering cursor in bottom right corner.
